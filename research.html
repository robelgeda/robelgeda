				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research teams at Rutgers have given me an opportunity to explore the universe at large and 
				microscopic scales. I am mainly working with two teams at Rutgers with physics backgrounds but very 
				different research applications. I have been working under professor Alyson Brooks on dark matter 
				simulations. I am currently developing software that can acutely track dark matter halos according to 
				their mass. The Rutgers Laser Spectroscopy Laboratory explores the quantum mechanics behind crystal 
				structures using Raman spectroscopy. I have been working on software to improve data analysis 
				procedures and will continue to do experiments in the near future. I have included descriptions of 
				projects I have been involved with.

				The team under professor Alyson Brooks performs analysis on data from dark matter halo simulations.
				The current interests of the team include the role irregular galaxies play on the formation of Milky Way 
				mass galaxies. This can be done by closely studying the dark matter halo associated with the galaxies 
				and how they merge to form a large structure. The simulations take into account variables such as 
				supernovae and star formation. <br/></p>

				My task has been to develop software, mostly written in IDL, to track the dark matter halos as they
				 progress through various time steps. So far we have been able to produce results with integrity and 
				plan on improving them. I am currently using Mathematica code (Wolfram language) to plot and display 
				the path taken by the galaxies. I have had the liberty of developing this procedure with a large degree of
				 freedom under the close supervision of Dr. Brooks. Since the final results are so resent, I will be able to 
				share them soon after various checks and presentations.

				Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, is a leading national research university and the state of 
				New Jersey&#39s preeminent, comprehensive public institution of higher education. Established in 1766 and 
				celebrating a milestone 250th anniversary in 2016, the university is the eighth-oldest higher education 
				institution in the United States. More than 65,000 students and 24,000 faculty and staff learn, work, and 
				serve the public at Rutgers locations across New Jersey and around the world.
