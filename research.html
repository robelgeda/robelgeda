				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research teams at Rutgers have given me an opportunity to explore the universe at large and 
				microscopic scales. I am mainly working with two teams at Rutgers with physics backgrounds but very 
				different research applications. I have been working under professor Alyson Brooks on dark matter 
				simulations. I am currently developing software that can acutely track dark matter halos according to 
				their mass. The Rutgers Laser Spectroscopy Laboratory explores the quantum mechanics behind crystal 
				structures using Raman spectroscopy. I have been working on software to improve data analysis 
				procedures and will continue to do experiments in the near future. I have included descriptions of 
				projects I have been involved with.

				The team under Professor Alyson Brooks performs analysis on data from dark matter halo simulations.
				The current interests of the team include the role irregular galaxies play on the formation of Milky Way 
				mass galaxies. This can be done by closely studying the dark matter halo associated with the galaxies 
				and how they merge to form a large structure. The simulations take into account variables such as 
				supernovae and star formation. <br/></p>

				<p style="color:white;">My task has been to develop software, mostly written in IDL, to track the dark matter halos as they
				 progress through various time steps. So far we have been able to produce results with integrity and 
				plan on improving them. I am currently using Mathematica code (Wolfram language) to plot and display 
				the path taken by the galaxies. I have had the liberty of developing this procedure with a large degree of
				 freedom under the close supervision of Dr. Brooks. Since the final results are so resent, I will be able to 
				share them after various checks and presentations.

				The Rutgers Laser Spectroscopy Laboratory under Professor Girsh Blumberg uses an optical table to 
				preform experiments on crystal samples. The current interests of the lab include superconductors and 
				topological insulators. These materials have a broad range of applications in electronics such as 
				superconducting materials with high Curie temperatures and quantum computing. The lab has made an 
				extensive effort in producing reliable data that can be used to measure phonons (molecular vibrations) 
				in the crystals. I am currently involved with improving the software used in analyzing the data produced 
				by the experiments. The main tool I have used for this task has been Mathematica. This computation 
				language has allowed me to customize Fourier transforms between frequency and time domains 
				according to the type of data. This is especially helpful in producing simultaneous fits and parameters 
				with reduced residuals. I will soon be helping with Raman experiments on a new batch of topological 
				insulators.

				I am involved with undergrad efforts to identify and confirm exoplanets using resources available at Rutgers 
				Physics. <a href=”http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0460v2.pdf “>The Kilo-degree Extremely Little Telescope 
				(KELT)</a> is an appropriately named tiny telescope which has been custom-designed to search for 
				transiting exoplanets.  The instrument takes images of the sky every few minutes to search for the slight 
				decrease in light which characterizes the passage of a planet in front of its star.  While KELT has generated 
				a list of candidates, they need help to do follow-up observations on their targets.  Thus we will be using 
				the 0.5 meter telescope at the Schommer Observatory to obtain light curves for these candidates to 
				confirm whether or not they are exoplanets.
