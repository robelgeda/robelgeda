		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a third year student at Rutgers University New Brunswick (RU) working towards a bachelors degree in Astrophysics and Mathematics. 
		During my time at RU, I have had the opportunity to explore a broad range of disciplines. My main interests include physics research, software development, marketing, and investment baking.
		My course work involves classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, probability, and methods to solve differential equations. The Rutgers Physics Department and Rutgers Resident Life Office are my current employers.
		I serve as a research assistant in physics labs and as an academic liaison. For more information on my employment history, please visit the work experience page.
